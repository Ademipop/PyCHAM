For a summer's day, windows assumed to be open at 7:00am (25200 s) and closed at 18:20 (66000 s).  Note that where possible both indoor and outdoor sources are accounted for, with the indoor source assumed constant (unless from an indoor activity) (ppb/s), but the outdoor one varying depending on whether windows open (and possibly if an outdoor diurnal cycle is known).

CO (carbon monoxide) has a mean indoor value of 0.4 ppb in Table 6 of https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/em/c9em00228f, and a mean outdoor concentration of 0.1 ppb in the same table.  Emission source indoors is combustion.  Assuming equilibrium the indoor contribution to CO is 0.4-0.1=0.3ppb.  Windows were closed for the 0.4 ppb measurement, so the indoor emission rate must be 0.3ppb*closed window dilution factor: 0.3*1.2e-4=3.6e-5
The influx from outdoors must change when windows open (to balance the loss caused by increased dil_fac):  when windows closed: 0.1ppb*1.2e-4 = 1.2e-5ppb/s, when windows open: 0.1ppb*3.7e-4=3.7e-5ppb/s.  Therefore indoor+outdoor is 3.6e-5+1.2e-5=4.8e-5ppb/s when windows closed and 3.6e-5+3.7e-5=7.3e-5ppb/s when windows open.

CH4 (methane) has a mean indoor value of 1.9e3 ppb in Table 6 of https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/em/c9em00228f, and a mean outdoor value of 1.88e3 ppb in the same table.  So, it looks like the outdoor source dominates even when windows are closed.
Therefore, we assumed no indoor source and just allow the outdoor source to balance the dilution factor: windows closed: 1.9e3*1.2e-4 = 2.28e-1 ppb/s, windows open 1.9e3*3.7e-4 =  7.03e-1 ppb/s

APINENE has a summertime outdoor concentration of 0.4 ppb and a wintertime outdoor concentration of 0.04 ppb (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341470550_Emissions_and_atmospheric_concentrations_of_a-pinene_at_an_urban_site_of_India_Role_of_changes_in_meteorology (DOI: 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.127071)).  Section 3.2 of UK study (DOI: 10.1039/D0EM00504E) says median annual value of alpha-pinene is 0.14 ppb (((0.8e-12/136.2)*si.N_A)/25034759936.935734).  The indoor concentration (ppb) is in Table 1 of Sarwar et al. (2002) (https://doi.org/10.1016/S1352-2310(02)00278-9): 0.5 ppb.  But they note that the outdoor concentration of alpha-pinene is 0.04 ppb, so the indoor concentration without outdoor source is (0.50-0.04) = 0.46 ppb, and the indoor emission rate when windows closed is then 0.46ppb*1.2e-4/s = 5.52e-5.  To this must be added the summertime Bradford outdoor influx which is (for summertime) 0.4ppb*1.2e-4/s = 4.8e-5, so sum is 5.52e-5+4.8e-5 ppb/s = 1.032e-4 ppb/s when windows closed. And for windows open, the indoor emission rate stays the same, but influx from outdoors increases to (dil_fac = 3.7e-4 /s*0.4 (ppb outdoors)) = 1.48e-4 pp/s, which, when added to the indoor emission rate (5.52e-5) is then 2.032e-4

O3 (ozone) assumed to have no indoor surface source, but does have outdoor source, and AURN for Leeds Centre in June 2022 shown here: https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/show-datavis?q=4250939&type=auto.  When windows closed, use the daily minimum (40 ppb)*dil_fac*infiltration factor (0.2).  When windows open: daily minimum (80 ppb)*dil_fac*infiltration factor(1.0)

NO (nitric oxide) has indoor source from NO2 deposition to surface (page 1483 of https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/show-datavis?q=4250939&type=auto), and has outdoor source, and AURN for Leeds Centre in June 2022 shown here: https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/show-datavis?q=4250939&type=auto.  When windows closed, use the daily minimum (0.3 ppb)*dil_fac*infiltration factor(1.0) = 3.6e-5 ppb/s.  When windows open: daily minimum (6 ppb)*dil_fac*infiltration factor(1.0) = 2.22e-3 ppb/s.  Although Table 6 of https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/em/c9em00228f (based on mean value) suggests an indoor source around 50 ppb of NO, Figure 4 of that publication shows the median value indoors is around 5 ppb and the median value outdoors is around 1 ppb, which gives an indoor source of 4 ppb when windows closed: 4.0*1.2e-4 = 4.8-4ppb/s.  Summing indoor and outdoor together gives 4.8e-4+3.6e-5=5.16e-4ppb/s when windows closed and 4.8e-4+2.22e-3=2.7e-3ppb/s when windows open

NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) does have outdoor source, and AURN for Leeds Centre in June 2022 shown here: https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/show-datavis?q=4250939&type=auto (results shown in brackets in next sentences).  When windows closed, use the daily minimum (10 ppb)*dil_fac*infiltration factor(0.72) = 8.64e-4 ppb/s.  When windows open: daily maximum (80 ppb)*dil_fac*infiltration factor(1.0) = 2.96e-2 ppb/s.  There is also an indoor source of 7-5 ppb=2ppb when windows closed in Table 6 of https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/em/c9em00228f, which gives an emission rate of 2ppb*dil_fac when windows closed = 2*1.2e-4 = 2.4e-4 ppb/s.  When summed with outdoor source we get: 2.4e-4+8.64e-4=1.104e-3 ppb/s when windows closed and 2.4e-4+2.96e-2=2.984e-2 ppb/s when windows open.


NO3 (nitrate radical) only produced indoors when ozone is high according to abtract of https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.8b00415, but this level of ozone (40 ppb), not seen yet in simulations, so no indoor surface source considered.  At night, NO3 reaches 10s of ppt according to https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/10/4187/2010/acp-10-4187-2010.pdf, so allow ingress of this at night time: (0.01 ppb)*dil_fac*infiltration factor(1.0) = 1.e-2*1.2e-4*1.0=1.2e-6ppb/s at night and 0 ppb/s in the day.

HNO3 (nitric acid) will enter buildings when windows open, and the suggested outdoor concentration is 2 ppb (abstract of doi.org/10.1021/es026133x) and Figure 4 of https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1073161X.1993.10467221?needAccess=true, therefore HNO3 allowed to enter building at a rate of 2ppb*dil_fac when windows open.  Both references above indicate that indoor concentrations of HNO3 are negligible unless a source such as an unvented convective space heater (which are now rare and possibly illegal to sell) is operating.  When windows and doors are closed, penetration factor of HNO3 is suggested to be sufficiently low to make HNO3 penetration from outdoors effectively negligible (doi.org/10.1021/es026133x).  Note that HNO3 concentrations are not measured at Leeds Headingley Kerbside.

HONO (nitrous acid) is suggested to be produced from NO2 reaction on wall, with 2 NO2 needed to make 1 HONO (page 1483 of https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1073161X.1993.10467221?needAccess=true and https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1001074220301297).  This is one suggested reason that indoor HONO is observed to be higher than outdoor HONO in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1001074220301297.  Using results from summertime in urban Beijing in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1001074220301297, outdoor HONO concentration averages 0.72 ppb and indoor HONO concentration averages 7.10.  So constant indoor emission is (7.10-0.72)ppb*1.2e-4/s = 7.656e-4 ppb/s and the outdoor flux in when windows closed is: 0.72*1.2e-4/s = 8.64e-5, so total flux when windows closed is: 7.656e-4+8.64e-5 and total flux when windows open is: 7.656e-4+0.72*3.7e-4 ppb/s

N2O5 (dinitrogen pentoxide) is generated at night outside at concentrations around 100 ppt according to https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/10/4187/2010/acp-10-4187-2010.pdf, however it is known to undergo heterogenous reaction to HNO3 (https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/11/4929/2011/acp-11-4929-2011.pdf).  Therefore, its infiltration factor seems likely to be zero.  And during the day outdoor concentrations are negligible.  Given that N2O5 forms HNO3 on surfaces, it seems unlikely it will be directly emitted from surfaces indoors.  Therefore, emission is set to zero, and any N2O5 is produced only from gas-phase chemistry (NO2+NO3 = N2O5)

H2O is set to maintain a relative humidity of 50 % when windows closed and 50 % when windows open (note that temperature is maintained at 20 oC).

SO2 is higher outdoors than indoors in table 1 of Sarwar et al. 2002 (doi.org/10.1016/S1352-2310(02)00278-9).  The indoor to outdoor ratio when windows closed is 1:4.6, therefore the penetration factor is 1/4.6 = 0.217, so emission rate when windows closed is: 4.6*1.2e-4*0.217 = 1.2e-4 and when windows open: 4.6*3.7e-4*1.=1.7e-3

Benzene is 2x higher indoors than outdoors in table 1 of Sarwar et al. 2002 (doi.org/10.1016/S1352-2310(02)00278-9).  Therefore a substantial outdoor source is possible.  No penetration factor could be found for benzene.  Therefore, I assume a penetration factor of 1.  When windows closed 2.5ppb*1.2e-4/s=3.e-4 ppb/s enters from outside.  When windows open 2.5ppb*3.7e-4/s=9.25e-4 ppb/s enters from outside.  In addition, 2.5 ppb comes from the inside (5ppb total indoor concentration when windows closed-2.5ppb of this from outdoor concentration=2.5ppb originating from the indoors).  So there is a constant indoor emission of  2.5ppb*1.2e-4/s=3.e-4ppb/s.  When windows closed, in total there is 6e=4 ppb/s (indoor+outdoor source), when windows open, in total there is 1.225e-3 ppb/s (indoor+outdoor source).

m-xylene, o-xylene, p-xylene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene follow the same method as benzene above

Components, C2H6 to TBUTOL (except for benzene, m-xylene, o-xylene, p-xylene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene which had at least 1/2 of the indoor concentration value for the outdoor concentration value), listed in the lit_source sheet of the const_infl.xlsx workbook are all assumed to originate from the indoors, so their emission rate is constant, even when ventilation changes, which will mean concentrations tend to go down when ventilation increases, since the loss rate will be the same.  Their emission rate is then calculated to give the literature value for indoor concentration at equilibrium when windows are closed (literature indoor concentration (ppb)*dil_fac(/s) (when windows closed)).
