# using MCMv3.3.1
# for +CO case, APINENE is 40 ppb, O3 is 0 ppb, CO is 9360.0 ppb (x234)
# because at 293.15 K and 101325 Pa:
# Reaction rate a-pinene with OH: 1.2D-11*EXP(440/TEMP) = 5.38e-11 cm3/molecule/s
# KMT05 (for CO with OH: KMT05 = 1.44D-13*(1+(M/4.2D+19)) and M (at 293.15 and 101325 Pa) =
# M_val = (PInit/(8.3144621*TEMP)*si.N_A)*1.e-6 = 2.5034761899869045e19
# giving a reaction rate coefficient of 2.30e-13 /molecule s, 
# finally: 5.38e-11/2.30e-13 = 234
# for CH4 case, APINENE is 40 ppb, O3 is 10 ppb, CH4 is 371040.0 ppb (x9276)
# because at 293.15 K and 101325 Pa:
# Reaction rate a-pinene with OH: 1.2D-11*EXP(440/TEMP) = 5.38e-11 /molecule s
# for CH4 with OH 1.85D-12*EXP(-1690/TEMP) : OH + CH4 = CH3O2 ;
# giving a reaction rate coefficient of 5.80e-15 cm3/molecule/s, 
# finally: 5.38e-11/5.80e-15 = 9276
# 50 ppb O3 is about average annual concentration for AURN measurement at Leeds Town Centre
