# in the model variables below seed particles are subject first to varying relative humidity at 
# constant temperature, even exceeding saturation; then are subject to a substantial increase 
# in temperature at constant absolute humidity, causing relative humidity to decrease to the 
# extent that the efflorescence relative humidity is passed; finally the temperature is 
# decreased, causing relative humidity to increase to the extent that the fluorescence relative 
# humidity is passed.  The resulting decreases in RH should lead to increases in evaporation 
# sufficient to destabilise the ODE solver, invoking the automatic decrease in integration time 
# interval to decrease the degree of relative humidity change.
